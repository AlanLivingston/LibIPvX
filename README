Welcome to LibIPvX. LibIPvX is a development library that enables C++ programmers with
IPv4 and IPv6 bitwise arithmetic, subnet calculation, instantiation of IP objects, range management 
and with no external dependencies needed using the power of C++11.

This library is 100% free for you to use respecting the constraints of the GNU General Public License.

We're well on the way to delivering the pre-alpha version of this library for use in
the comming weeks. The bleeding edge code is available if you're interested in having a look.
