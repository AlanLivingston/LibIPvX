LibIPvX is a development library that provide C++ programmers with
IPv4 and IPv6 bitwise arithmetic, subnet calculation, instantiation of IP objects, range management 
and with no external dependencies needed using the power of C++11.

This library is 100% free for you to use respecting the constraints of the GNU General Public License.

We're well on the way to delivering the pre-alpha version of this library in
the coming weeks. The bleeding edge code is available if you're interested in having a look, and the
library doesn't yet refer to an actual library (DLL) in the true sense of the word, and for the moment
is just a few of classes.

If you're interested in how the library works, look at the smoketests contained in main.cpp.
