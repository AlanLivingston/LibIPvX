Intro:

LibIPvX is a tiny development library that provides C++ programmers with IPv4 and IPv6 bitwise arithmetic, subnetting calculation, native IP classes, address range iteration and all just only with the requirements of C++11, no external dependencies are needed.

This library is 100% free for you to use respecting the constraints of the GNU General Public License.

We're well on the way to delivering the alpha of this library in the coming weeks. The bleeding edge code is available if you're keen to have a look, but for the moment LibIPvX doesn't yet refer to an actual link library (DLL) executable, and is for the moment only a series of classes.

In lieu of the documentation, if you're interested in how the library works, look at the smoketests in main.cpp, but don't worry, the official documentation, website and support forums are on the roadmap for the first release!

Prior to the first library release, be aware that method, class and variable names may change and as such code shouldn't be placed inside a production environment as backwards compatiability cannot be assured between subsequent code changes up until the first release.

API Documentation:

To generate the LIBIPvX API documentation, you will need to install Robodoc, once you've done that, run ./gen_api_doc.sh and it will be generated to the doc directory.
